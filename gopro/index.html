            <h1>GoPro Photography</h1>

            <p>
                The GoPro liberates your imagination by allowing you to capture situations that in the recent past seemed like fantasies. Since the early days of motion-picture capture, people always had the desire to present each shot with a unique perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point or another, we've all wanted to mount a video camera on a car bumper to capture compelling footage or fly it remotely over the action on some hobby craft, but doing so was never feasible or practical. The ambitious efforts of the more adventurous often ended in a crash landing.

            <h1>What is GoPro?</h1>

            <p>
                GoPro, Inc. (marketed as GoPro and sometimes stylised as GoPRO) is an American technology company founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman. It manufactures eponymous action cameras and develops its own mobile apps and video-editing software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded as Woodman Labs, Inc, the company eventually focused on the connected sports genre, developing its line of action cameras and, later, video editing software. It also developed a quadcopter drone, Karma, released in October 2016.
            </p>
            <p>  
                In October 2016, before the release of "Karma" quadcopter drone, GoPro released the GoPro "HERO 5" and "HERO 5 Session"
