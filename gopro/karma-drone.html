                Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life. The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
